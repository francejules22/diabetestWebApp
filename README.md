# ResultAndDiscussion
## Confusion Matrix - The confusion matrix is used by data scientists to summarize the results of classification problems. 
In this case, it is used to classify whether the user has a high risk or low risk of having type II diabetes. It is also used to predict the number of correct and incorrect predictions of the classification model. 
Among all the models created the Gradient boosting model garnered the highest True Positive Score. It predicted that 65.38% of the entries in the dataset are positive or at high risk of type II diabetes and it is true based on the predicted and actual values. 
Gradient boosting also got the highest True negative score. It predicted that 32.69% of entries in the dataset are negative or at low risk of having type II diabetes. The Gradient boosting algorithm only has 1 false positive prediction. 
It is also the lowest among all models. It only has 2 false negative predictions which are also the lowest among the others. In terms of confusion matrix evaluation, the Gradient Boosting algorithm outperforms all the algorithms tested.
